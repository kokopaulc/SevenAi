        "\n",
        "* The initial attempt to check Docker and Ollama versions failed due to the tools not being found in the execution environment, highlighting the need for their prior installation.\n",
        "* Through simulation, hypothetical versions were obtained: Docker 24.0.7 and Ollama 0.1.29.\n",
        "* The simulated environment indicated a running Open WebUI container named `openwebui`, exposing port 8080 and mounting a volume from host `/data` to container `/app/data`.\n",
        "* A Dockerfile structure was defined for the \"Seven\" container, using Alpine Linux as a base, copying core logic from a `./seven_core` directory, and setting a Python entry point.\n",
        "* Communication between containers (Seven, Ollama, Open WebUI) is planned via a shared Docker bridge network, allowing containers to reference each other by container name (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`).\n",
        "* Configuration within the \"Seven\" container for the Ollama address will use an environment variable (`OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL`).\n",
        "* Open WebUI will likely interact with Ollama directly, and \"Seven\" might expose an API or use shared storage for specific functionalities, rather than being a primary LLM endpoint for Open WebUI.\n",
        "* A simple, file-based JSON knowledge base (`knowledge.json`) is planned for \"Seven\"'s learning mechanism, prioritizing learned information over LLM responses.\n",
        "* A command format (`/learn \"<query_or_topic>\" \"<information_to_learn>\"`) is proposed for adding information to the knowledge base via the chat interface.\n",
        "* Selective cloud LLM utilization is planned for complex or recent knowledge tasks, with a decision mechanism potentially based on query analysis or user instruction.\n",
        "* Cloud LLM credentials will be managed securely via environment variables or Docker Secrets.\n",
        "* A Python installation script (`setup.py`) is planned to automate the setup process, including prerequisite checks, Docker image building/pulling, network setup, Docker Compose file generation, and container startup.\n",
        "* The installation script will include error handling for failed commands and allow user configuration via arguments or a config file.\n",
        "* A comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough guide is provided, covering prerequisites, obtaining files, running the script, verification, using Open WebUI, utilizing the learning mechanism, cloud LLM setup, and troubleshooting.\n",

            "## Obtaining the Setup Script and Files\n",
            "The 'Seven' setup script and associated files (core logic, Dockerfile, example configuration) will be made available through a repository.\n",
            "1. **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository containing the 'Seven' project files:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   git clone <repository_url>\n",
            "   cd <repository_directory>\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the 'Seven' project repository and `<repository_directory>` with the name of the directory created by cloning.\n",
            "2. **Explore the Files:** Inside the repository directory, you will find:\n",
            "   - `setup.py`: The main Python setup script.\n",
            "   - `seven_core/`: Directory containing the core logic for 'Seven', including `main.py` and `requirements.txt`.\n",
            "   - `seven_core/Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile used to build the 'Seven' container image.\n",
            "   - `config/`: Directory potentially containing example configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`).\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Running the Installation Script\n",
            "The `setup.py` script automates the installation process.\n",
            "1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the cloned repository directory if you are not already there.\n",
            "2. **Run the setup script:** Execute the script using Python:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   python setup.py\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "3. **Configuration (Optional):** The script may accept command-line arguments or use a configuration file for customization. Refer to the script's help message for options:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   python setup.py --help\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   Common configuration options might include:\n",
            "   - Specifying which Ollama models to download (`--model`).\n",
            "   - Changing the port for Open WebUI (`--webui-port`).\n",
            "   - Setting the directory for persistent data storage (`--data-dir`).\n",
            "   If using a configuration file (e.g., `config/config.yaml`), you might specify it like:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   python setup.py --config config/config.yaml\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "4. **Follow On-Screen Prompts:** The script may ask for confirmation or require input for certain configurations.\n",
            "The script will perform the following actions:\n",
            "- Check for required dependencies (Docker, Docker Compose).\n",
            "- Build the 'Seven' Docker image.\n",
            "- Create a dedicated Docker network.\n",
            "- Pull the specified Ollama model image(s).\n",
            "- Pull the Open WebUI Docker image.\n",
            "- Generate a `docker-compose.yaml` file based on your configuration.\n",
            "- Start the Docker containers for 'Seven', Ollama, and Open WebUI.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Verifying the Installation\n",
            "After the script finishes, you can verify that the containers are running correctly:\n",
            "1. **List Running Containers:** Open your terminal and run the following command:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   docker ps\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   You should see at least three containers listed with a status of 'Up':\n",
            "   - A container for 'Seven' (image name likely starts with the project/directory name followed by '_seven').\n",
            "   - A container for Ollama (image name `ollama/ollama`).\n",
            "   - A container for Open WebUI (image name `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui`).\n",
            "2. **Check Container Logs (Optional):** To view the logs for a specific container, use the `docker logs` command followed by the container ID or name (found in the `docker ps` output). For example:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   docker logs <seven_container_id_or_name>\n",
            "   docker logs <ollama_container_id_or_name>\n",
            "   docker logs <openwebui_container_id_or_name>\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   Look for messages indicating successful startup and initialization.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Accessing and Using Open WebUI\n",
            "Open WebUI provides the user interface for interacting with 'Seven' (via Ollama).\n",
            "1. **Open your web browser** and go to the address where Open WebUI is exposed. By default, this is usually:\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   http://localhost:8080\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "2. **Create a User Account:** If this is your first time accessing Open WebUI, you will need to create a user account. This is stored locally within the Open WebUI container.\n",
            "3. **Select a Model:** Once logged in, you should see an interface similar to other chat-based AI assistants. In the model selection dropdown (usually at the top), choose the Ollama model you downloaded during installation (e.g., `llama2`).\n",
            "4. **Start Interacting:** You can now type your prompts and questions into the chat box. Open WebUI will send these prompts to the Ollama container, which will use the selected model to generate responses.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Using 'Seven's Learning Mechanism\n",
            "'Seven' has a basic learning mechanism based on a knowledge base. This allows it to store and recall specific information you provide.\n",
            "The learning mechanism is designed to prioritize learned information over general LLM responses.\n",
            "To add new information to 'Seven's knowledge base, you will use a specific command format within the Open WebUI chat interface. The 'Seven' core logic listens for these specific commands.\n",
            "The command format is:\n",
            "```\n",
            "/learn \"<query_or_topic>\" \"<information_to_learn>\"\n",
            "```\n",
            "Replace `<query_or_topic>` with the phrase or question you want 'Seven' to associate the information with, and `<information_to_learn>` with the actual information.\n",
            "Example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "/learn \"my favorite color\" \"blue\"\n",
            "```\n",
            "When you send this command, 'Seven' will process it, update its internal knowledge base, and save it persistently. The system should provide a confirmation message (potentially in the chat interface itself or in the 'Seven' container logs).\n",
            "Subsequently, if you ask 'Seven' the exact query or a closely matching variation (depending on the matching logic implemented), it should recall and provide the learned information instead of generating a new response from the LLM.\n",
            "Example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "What is my favorite color?\n",
            "```\n",
            "Expected Response (if learned):\n",
            "```\n",
            "Your favorite color is blue.\n",
            "```\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Training and Fine-tuning (Due to Hardware Limitations)\n",
            "Given the user's limited hardware resources, directly fine-tuning large language models is not feasible with this basic setup.\n",
            "Fine-tuning requires significant computational power (GPUs) and storage, which are typically beyond the scope of the target hardware for this project.\n",
            "The primary 'learning' mechanism implemented in this setup is the file-based knowledge base, which allows 'Seven' to store and recall specific facts and information without modifying the underlying language model weights.\n",
            "Therefore, this basic installation of 'Seven' does *not* include functionality for training or fine-tuning the Ollama models.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Configuring and Using Cloud LLMs\n",
            "'Seven' is designed to be offline-first, relying primarily on the local Ollama models. However, it has the capability to selectively utilize cloud LLMs for tasks that are better suited for them (e.g., complex queries, up-to-date information).\n",
            "1. **Obtain API Keys:** You will need to obtain API keys from your chosen cloud LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic). Be aware that using cloud LLMs incurs costs based on usage.\n",
            "2. **Configure Credentials:** Securely provide your API keys to the 'Seven' container. This is typically done by setting environment variables when the container starts. You can modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file generated by the setup script to include these.\n",
            "   Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file and add an `environment` section to the `seven` service:\n",
            "   ```yaml\n",
            "   services:\n",
            "     seven:\n",
            "       # ... other configurations\n",
            "       environment:\n",
            "         - OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
            "         - GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\n",
            "         # Add other API keys as needed\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your actual API keys.\n",
            "3. **Restart Containers:** After modifying `docker-compose.yaml`, restart the 'Seven' service (or all services) to apply the changes:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   docker compose down seven\n",
            "   docker compose up -d seven\n",
            "   # Or restart all services:\n",
            "   # docker compose down\n",
            "   # docker compose up -d\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "4. **Trigger Cloud LLM Usage:** The 'Seven' core logic will decide when to use a cloud LLM based on the query or specific user instructions. You might be able to preface a query with a command to force cloud usage (e.g., `/cloud <your query>`). Refer to the 'Seven' core logic documentation (within the cloned repository) for specific commands or criteria that trigger cloud usage.\n",
            "**Potential Costs:** Be mindful of the costs associated with cloud LLM usage. Monitor your usage on the cloud provider's platform.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Troubleshooting Tips\n",
            "Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:\n",
            "1. **`docker command not found` or `docker compose command not found`:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** Docker or Docker Compose is not installed or not in your system's PATH.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Install Docker and Docker Compose according to the prerequisites. Ensure your terminal session is refreshed or your system is restarted after installation.\n",
            "2. **Permission errors when running `docker` commands:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** Your user does not have permission to access the Docker daemon.\n",
            "   - **Solution (Linux):** Add your user to the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. You will need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\n",
            "3. **Containers not starting (`docker ps` shows exited status):**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** An error occurred during container startup.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Check the logs of the affected container(s) using `docker logs <container_id_or_name>` to identify the specific error message. Common issues include incorrect configuration, missing files, or dependency problems within the container.\n",
            "4. **Open WebUI not accessible on `localhost:8080`:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** The container is not running, the port mapping is incorrect, or another service is already using port 8080.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Verify the Open WebUI container is running using `docker ps`. Check the `docker-compose.yaml` file for the correct port mapping. If port 8080 is in use, stop the conflicting service or modify the `docker-compose.yaml` to map to a different host port.\n",
            "5. **Ollama model not loading or responding:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** The model was not downloaded correctly, the Ollama container is not running, or the 'Seven'/'Open WebUI' container cannot connect to the Ollama container.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Check the Ollama container logs (`docker logs <ollama_container_id_or_name>`). Verify the model was pulled successfully using `docker exec <ollama_container_id_or_name> ollama list`. Ensure the containers are on the same Docker network and the `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in 'Seven' and Open WebUI (if applicable) is correct (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`).\n",
            "6. **Learning command (`/learn`) not working:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** The 'Seven' container is not running, the command format is incorrect, or there's an issue with the 'Seven' core logic processing the command or saving the knowledge base.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Verify the 'Seven' container is running. Double-check the command syntax `/learn \"<query>\" \"<information>\"`. Check the logs of the 'Seven' container for any error messages related to processing the command or file I/O for the knowledge base.\n",

        "\n",
        "* The initial attempt to check Docker and Ollama versions failed due to the tools not being found in the execution environment, highlighting the need for their prior installation.\n",
        "* Through simulation, hypothetical versions were obtained: Docker 24.0.7 and Ollama 0.1.29.\n",
        "* The simulated environment indicated a running Open WebUI container named `openwebui`, exposing port 8080 and mounting a volume from host `/data` to container `/app/data`.\n",
        "* A Dockerfile structure was defined for the \"Seven\" container, using Alpine Linux as a base, copying core logic from a `./seven_core` directory, and setting a Python entry point.\n",
        "* Communication between containers (Seven, Ollama, Open WebUI) is planned via a shared Docker bridge network, allowing containers to reference each other by name (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`).\n",
        "* Configuration within the \"Seven\" container for the Ollama address will use an environment variable (`OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL`).\n",
        "* Open WebUI will likely interact with Ollama directly, and \"Seven\" might expose an API or use shared storage for specific functionalities, rather than being a primary LLM endpoint for Open WebUI.\n",
        "* A simple, file-based JSON knowledge base (`knowledge.json`) is planned for \"Seven\"'s learning mechanism, prioritizing learned information over LLM responses.\n",
        "* A command format (`/learn \"<query_or_topic>\" \"<information_to_learn>\"`) is proposed for adding information to the knowledge base via the chat interface.\n",
        "* Selective cloud LLM utilization is planned for complex or recent knowledge tasks, with a decision mechanism potentially based on query analysis or user instruction.\n",
        "* Cloud LLM credentials will be managed securely via environment variables or Docker Secrets.\n",
        "* A Python installation script (`setup.py`) is planned to automate the setup process, including prerequisite checks, Docker image building/pulling, network setup, Docker Compose file generation, and container startup.\n",
        "* The installation script will include error handling for failed commands and allow user configuration via arguments or a config file.\n",
        "* A comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough guide is provided, covering prerequisites, obtaining files, running the script, verification, using Open WebUI, utilizing the learning mechanism, cloud LLM setup, and troubleshooting.\n",
        "* The plan explicitly states that direct model training or fine-tuning is not feasible on limited hardware for this basic setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",

            "   ```\n",
            "4. **Follow On-Screen Prompts:** The script may ask for confirmation or require input for certain configurations.\n",
            "The script will perform the following actions:\n",
            "- Check for required dependencies (Docker, Docker Compose).\n",
            "- Build the 'Seven' Docker image.\n",
            "- Create a dedicated Docker network.\n",
            "- Pull the specified Ollama model image(s).\n",
            "- Pull the Open WebUI Docker image.\n",
            "- Generate a `docker-compose.yaml` file based on your configuration.\n",
            "- Start the Docker containers for 'Seven', Ollama, and Open WebUI.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Verifying the Installation\n",
            "After the script finishes, you can verify that the containers are running correctly:\n",
            "1. **List Running Containers:** Open your terminal and run the following command:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   docker ps\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   You should see at least three containers listed with a status of 'Up':\n",
            "   - A container for 'Seven' (image name likely starts with the project/directory name followed by '_seven').\n",
            "   - A container for Ollama (image name `ollama/ollama`).\n",
            "   - A container for Open WebUI (image name `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui`).\n",
            "2. **Check Container Logs (Optional):** To view the logs for a specific container, use the `docker logs` command followed by the container ID or name (found in the `docker ps` output). For example:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   docker logs <seven_container_id_or_name>\n",
            "   docker logs <ollama_container_id_or_name>\n",
            "   docker logs <openwebui_container_id_or_name>\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   Look for messages indicating successful startup and initialization.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Accessing and Using Open WebUI\n",
            "Open WebUI provides the user interface for interacting with 'Seven' (via Ollama).\n",
            "1. **Open your web browser** and go to the address where Open WebUI is exposed. By default, this is usually:\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   http://localhost:8080\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "2. **Create a User Account:** If this is your first time accessing Open WebUI, you will need to create a user account. This is stored locally within the Open WebUI container.\n",
            "3. **Select a Model:** Once logged in, you should see an interface similar to other chat-based AI assistants. In the model selection dropdown (usually at the top), choose the Ollama model you downloaded during installation (e.g., `llama2`).\n",
            "4. **Start Interacting:** You can now type your prompts and questions into the chat box. Open WebUI will send these prompts to the Ollama container, which will use the selected model to generate responses.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Using 'Seven's Learning Mechanism\n",
            "'Seven' has a basic learning mechanism based on a knowledge base. This allows it to store and recall specific information you provide.\n",
            "The learning mechanism is designed to prioritize learned information over general LLM responses.\n",
            "To add new information to 'Seven's knowledge base, you will use a specific command format within the Open WebUI chat interface. The 'Seven' core logic listens for these specific commands.\n",
            "The command format is:\n",
            "```\n",
            "/learn \"<query_or_topic>\" \"<information_to_learn>\"\n",
            "```\n",
            "Replace `<query_or_topic>` with the phrase or question you want 'Seven' to associate the information with, and `<information_to_learn>` with the actual information.\n",
            "Example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "/learn \"my favorite color\" \"blue\"\n",
            "```\n",
            "When you send this command, 'Seven' will process it, update its internal knowledge base, and save it persistently. The system should provide a confirmation message (potentially in the chat interface itself or in the 'Seven' container logs).\n",
            "Subsequently, if you ask 'Seven' the exact query or a closely matching variation (depending on the matching logic implemented), it should recall and provide the learned information instead of generating a new response from the LLM.\n",
            "Example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "What is my favorite color?\n",
            "```\n",
            "Expected Response (if learned):\n",
            "```\n",
            "Your favorite color is blue.\n",
            "```\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Training and Fine-tuning (Due to Hardware Limitations)\n",
            "Given the user's limited hardware resources, directly fine-tuning large language models is not feasible with this basic setup.\n",
            "Fine-tuning requires significant computational power (GPUs) and storage, which are typically beyond the scope of the target hardware for this project.\n",
            "The primary 'learning' mechanism implemented in this setup is the file-based knowledge base, which allows 'Seven' to store and recall specific facts and information without modifying the underlying language model weights.\n",
            "Therefore, this basic installation of 'Seven' does *not* include functionality for training or fine-tuning the Ollama models.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Configuring and Using Cloud LLMs\n",
            "'Seven' is designed to be offline-first, relying primarily on the local Ollama models. However, it has the capability to selectively utilize cloud LLMs for tasks that are better suited for them (e.g., complex queries, up-to-date information).\n",
            "1. **Obtain API Keys:** You will need to obtain API keys from your chosen cloud LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI, Anthropic). Be aware that using cloud LLMs incurs costs based on usage.\n",
            "2. **Configure Credentials:** Securely provide your API keys to the 'Seven' container. This is typically done by setting environment variables when the container starts. You can modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file generated by the setup script to include these.\n",
            "   Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file and add an `environment` section to the `seven` service:\n",
            "   ```yaml\n",
            "   services:\n",
            "     seven:\n",
            "       # ... other configurations\n",
            "       environment:\n",
            "         - OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
            "         - GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\n",
            "         # Add other API keys as needed\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your actual API keys.\n",
            "3. **Restart Containers:** After modifying `docker-compose.yaml`, restart the 'Seven' service (or all services) to apply the changes:\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   docker compose down seven\n",
            "   docker compose up -d seven\n",
            "   # Or restart all services:\n",
            "   # docker compose down\n",
            "   # docker compose up -d\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "4. **Trigger Cloud LLM Usage:** The 'Seven' core logic will decide when to use a cloud LLM based on the query or specific user instructions. You might be able to preface a query with a command to force cloud usage (e.g., `/cloud <your query>`). Refer to the 'Seven' core logic documentation (within the cloned repository) for specific commands or criteria that trigger cloud usage.\n",
            "**Potential Costs:** Be mindful of the costs associated with cloud LLM usage. Monitor your usage on the cloud provider's platform.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "## Troubleshooting Tips\n",
            "Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:\n",
            "1. **`docker command not found` or `docker compose command not found`:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** Docker or Docker Compose is not installed or not in your system's PATH.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Install Docker and Docker Compose according to the prerequisites. Ensure your terminal session is refreshed or your system is restarted after installation.\n",
            "2. **Permission errors when running `docker` commands:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** Your user does not have permission to access the Docker daemon.\n",
            "   - **Solution (Linux):** Add your user to the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. You will need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\n",
            "3. **Containers not starting (`docker ps` shows exited status):**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** An error occurred during container startup.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Check the logs of the affected container(s) using `docker logs <container_id_or_name>` to identify the specific error message. Common issues include incorrect configuration, missing files, or dependency problems within the container.\n",
            "4. **Open WebUI not accessible on `localhost:8080`:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** The container is not running, the port mapping is incorrect, or another service is already using port 8080.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Verify the Open WebUI container is running using `docker ps`. Check the `docker-compose.yaml` file for the correct port mapping. If port 8080 is in use, stop the conflicting service or modify the `docker-compose.yaml` to map to a different host port.\n",
            "5. **Ollama model not loading or responding:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** The model was not downloaded correctly, the Ollama container is not running, or the 'Seven'/'Open WebUI' container cannot connect to the Ollama container.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Check the Ollama container logs (`docker logs <ollama_container_id_or_name>`). Verify the model was pulled successfully using `docker exec <ollama_container_id_or_name> ollama list`. Ensure the containers are on the same Docker network and the `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in 'Seven' and Open WebUI (if applicable) is correct (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`).\n",
            "6. **Learning command (`/learn`) not working:**\n",
            "   - **Reason:** The 'Seven' container is not running, the command format is incorrect, or there's an issue with the 'Seven' core logic processing the command or saving the knowledge base.\n",
            "   - **Solution:** Verify the 'Seven' container is running. Double-check the command syntax `/learn \"<query>\" \"<information>\"`. Check the logs of the 'Seven' container for any error messages related to processing the command or file I/O for the knowledge base.\n",

        "*   The simulated environment indicated a running Open WebUI container named `openwebui`, exposing port 8080 and mounting a volume from host `/data` to container `/app/data`.\n",
        "*   A Dockerfile structure was defined for the \"Seven\" container, using Alpine Linux as a base, copying core logic from a `./seven_core` directory, and setting a Python entry point.\n",
        "*   Communication between containers (Seven, Ollama, Open WebUI) is planned via a shared Docker bridge network, allowing containers to reference each other by name (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`).\n",
        "*   Configuration within the \"Seven\" container for the Ollama address will use an environment variable (`OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL`).\n",
        "*   Open WebUI will likely interact with Ollama directly, and \"Seven\" might expose an API or use shared storage for specific functionalities, rather than being a primary LLM endpoint for Open WebUI.\n",
